####n_sci Science Image and Data toolbox



This is planned to be a module containing useful methods to read, manipulate and write different data as used regularly in neuro/science research.



Initial Planned functionality:

-Store large datasets of images and sensor data in databases

-Segment imaging data based on changing pixel values

-Removal of motion artifacts from imaging data

-Hardware control of cameras



This will get extended as needed
